## Day 2
Optimization is essential, a weak code which takes about 3 minutes to run using list was optimized to less than 0.3 seconds using another data structure called set. The idea was to find palingrams which are palindrome pair words like _nurses run_ .

##### Your code should be optimized because time is ðŸ’°ðŸ¤‘.
 > Note: Using c_profile by importing cProfile module for the program, a particular output is displayed which shows the time each function required to run and the number of times it ran.
 > Changing the data structure from list to set optimized the time, list takes linear time to add and search whereas set which avoids duplicate values was suited best for this program

#### Key takeaways 
* Learn to optimize your program using important Data Structure.
* Try to check the time required by your algorithm and the number of times a function is called using Profiling.
