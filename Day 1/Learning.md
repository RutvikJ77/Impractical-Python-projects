## Day 1
It is easy to type out the program but the process to become a software engineer requires professional steps. Like in this program there is nothing extraordinary but the highlight is formatting which is required in industries. 

##### Your code should look clean and crisp. As in hot out of oven 🍕.
 > Note: The experience gained here is about formatting and using pylint module to score our the program file on the basis of 10. 
 > Just typing out the program gave me a score of 3.67/10 which shooked me at first.

#### Key takeaways 
* Use pylint to score your program.
* Use docstring formating (Even google has their own style of formatting the [docstirngs](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html.).)
* Develop the habit of consistency.
